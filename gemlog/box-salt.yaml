  Last year, I figured out how to use HashiCorp Vagrant to provision and manage virtual machines on a Chromebook. I used that for some lightweight tinkering and to learn a bit more about how to use Salt for configuration management in a safe and self-contained environment.

  Well, I'm about to need to do a lot more Salt work, so last night I decided to refresh my Vagrant setup a bit.
