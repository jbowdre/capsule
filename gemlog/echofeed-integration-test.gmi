This is a quick post to see if this absolute nonsense[1] I have cobbled together actually works.      If it works:

=> https://github.com/jbowdre/capsule/blob/main/.github/workflows/markdown2gempost.yml 1: absolute nonsense

- EchoFeed[1] will see this post in my Scribbles RSS feed, and relay it to my GitHub repo as a Markdown file.
=> https://echofeed.app 1: EchoFeed

- My new GitHub Actions workflow will see the new Markdown file, use a script and md2gmi[1] in a Docker container to convert the Markdown to Gemtext along with a YAML metadata sidecar for gempost, and store the results in the repo.
- The existing workflow will see the new gemtext post and use gempost[2] to (re)build the site, and then deploy it to my virtual server where it will be made available within Geminispace.

=> https://github.com/justlark/gempost 2: gempost

I really hope this works.
