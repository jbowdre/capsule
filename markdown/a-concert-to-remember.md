My wife and I drove to Nashville last night to attend the final show of A Day To Remember's The Least Anticipated Album Tour, with The Story So Far, Four Year Strong, and Scowl.

Scowl was loud and kind of chaotic (in the best way), though not really my cup of tea.

Four Year Strong played a solid set with great energy.

The Story So Far basically stood in one place the whole time, so that was kind of boring.

But oh-my-goodness did ADTR **Bring It**.

They performed a 90-ish minute set jam-packed with high-intensity hits. They used tons of pyro, confetti cannons, streamers, beach balls, and tons of pyro to really accent the heavy breakdowns for which they are known.

And Nashville loved it. Fifteenish folks completed the "surfing a on a crowd surfer" challenge *during a single song*. It was nuts.

The openers were *fine* but ADTR absolutely put on one of the most-fun shows I've been to in a while.
