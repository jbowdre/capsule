  I recently picked up a BOOX Note Air3 C color e-ink writing tablet, with the intention of using it for reading ebooks, taking notes, sketching out diagrams, and marking up PDF documents.

  I've now spent just shy of two weeks using it on a near-daily basis. I'm not looking to write a full-on review, but I thought I'd share some thoughts on how the Air3 has been working out for me.

  And it's been working out very, very well.
