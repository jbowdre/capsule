*Here's what I've been up to since the last weekly status[1]...*

=> /this-week-2024-09-08 1: last weekly status

### Highlights

- This week was kind of a blur as a I scrambled to tie up remaining loose ends leading up to my last day at work. It took a lot of doing but I'm pleased with how I left things; hopefully all the stuff I built won't fall apart *too* quickly without me.

- My (now former) boss surprised me with a letter of recommendation that says some really nice things about me. That feels pretty good.
- I'm expecting a sizeable payout for my (extensive) unused vacation time so I splurged on some bike gear: a pair of Garmin Rally XC200[1] power-sensing pedals. We got some weather toward the end of the week so I haven't had a chance to ride with them yet, but I'm really looking forward to tracking my power data starting tomorrow.
- I ended the week with a much-needed autocross race[2]. (I always get a bit twitchy when it's been too long between events.)

### I wrote...

- I reflected a bit[1] on the things I accomplished in my last job as I get ready to start a new one. It was pretty satisfying to look back at the impact I had there.

### I consumed...

- We watched the final installment of The Grand Tour[1]: *One for the Road*. I've been following the vehicular adventures of Clarkson, Hammond, and May for twenty years, and this last hurrah was a good one to end on. But man, I'm going to miss watching those guys. (Also, Zimbabwe is stunning!) - We started Only Murders in the Building[2] and I'm enjoying it quite a lot. Steve Martin and Martin Short are such a delight together.

- My wife and I continued our little Alien marathon[1] with Alien: Covenant[2]. I guess now we'll have to go see Alien: Romulus[3] soon.

- We also watched Elvira: Mistress of the Dark[1]. What a treat!
- I finished reading Jason Pargin's If This Book Exists, You're in the Wrong Universe[2], and started reading Consider Phlebas[3] by Iain M. Banks.
