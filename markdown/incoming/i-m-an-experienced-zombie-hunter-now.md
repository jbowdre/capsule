Last night we met up with some friends we hadn't seen in a while, drove into the deep woods an hour outside of town, loaded up with 200 rounds of ammo each, and set out to kill the walking dead. Zombies emerged from broken-down buildings and vehicles, behind trees and tombstones, and one even appeared on a zipline. They stalked/crawled towards us, and we started shooting, and didn't stop until they were dead (again?).

I should *probably* clarify that we were riding in a trailer pulled by a 2.5 ton military truck, shooting paintball guns connected to giant nitrogen tanks, and that the zombies were (presumably) teenagers wearing suspiciously more padding than the slightly-chilly weather warranted and neon colors. This was the [Zombie Paintball Thrill Ride at Grace Hill Farms](https://gracehillfarmsal.com/zombie-paintball/), and it was a lot of fun - honestly much more than I had anticipated given the family-friendly nature of the thing. Unloading dozens of paintballs at a time at slow-moving well-armored targets was pretty satisfying, and the combination of black light floodlights on the sides of the trailer and neon paintballs made it look like we were firing tracer rounds. It was a really neat effect.
