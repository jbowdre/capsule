*Here's what I've been up to since the [last weekly status](/this-week-2024-08-11)...*

### Highlights

- This week, I began to train in earnest for the 40-ish mile bike ride a friend and I are doing next month... and discovered a few maintenance actions that need tending before I get too much further along.
    - The new-to-me [Crosstrail](/new-ride/) has developed a slight crank wobble so that I feel a "click" with each pedal. I took bits off until I could confirm (I think?) that the bottom bracket is just ever-so-slightly loose and allows that wiggle at the top/bottom of each stroke. Of course, I need a very specific socket to be able to tighten that; USPS *should* deliver that sometime today so I can maybe get the bike ready to ride again tomorrow.
    - I pulled my previous Trek Verve 1 out of retirement on Friday when I realized that I probably shouldn't ride the Crosstrail anymore until its fixed. That felt weird (but fine) for most of the ride, but I noticed a lot of noise coming from the rear hub toward the end of it. Sure enough, those bearings are spinning smoothly. I think I can take it apart, clean it, re-grease it, and put it back together - but, again, that requires a very specific tool that won't be here until later this week.
    - On the bright side, I'm learning a ton about how bikes work!
- We were gifted a grocery bag full of fresh rosemary, so spent most of today drying it in the oven. The house smelled so great, and we collected enough dried rosemary leaves to completely fill a mason jar. Now I just need to steal my mom's recipe for lemon rosemary cookies (I *think* it's similar to [this one](https://nursingmyappetite.com/2015/06/25/lemon-rosemary-shortbread-cookies-with-sea-salt/)).

### I learned...

- I was reminded how handy [SSH escape sequences](https://notes.runtimeterror.dev/Linux/SSH-Escape-Sequences) can be. (Next time you find yourself stuck in a hung SSH session, hit enter and then type `~.` to terminate the session from the client side.)
- Some time back, I shifted to using `env` to call the appropriate shell in scripts. So instead of:
    
    <div class="highlight">```
    <span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash -eu</span>
    ```
    
    </div>I did:
    
    <div class="highlight">```
    <span></span><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>
    <span class="nb">set</span><span class="w"> </span>-eu
    ```
    
    </div>Well, this week I remembered/relearned that passing the `-S` argument to `env` will let you pass additional args to the shell it's calling. So now, I do:
    
    <div class="highlight">```
    <span></span><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/env -S bash -eu</span>
    ```
    
    </div>That's way better.

### I tinkered...

- I did quite a bit of fumbling and (eventually) implemented an optional light theme over on [the other blog](https://runtimeterror.dev). It *should* honor your system/browser preference, and you can also click the sun/moon icon at the top right to manually switch color schemes. As always, I learned a ton about CSS in the process.

### I wrote...

- I haven't published any new posts (aside from this one), but I'm working on a few drafts. (Stopping in the middle of the week to hack on the theme toggle kind of upset my momentum.) I hope to at least get one or two of those drafts out this week.

### I consumed...

- I listened to a *lot* of ska this week, and my most-played track was [Here in Your Bedroom by Goldfinger](https://musicthread.app/link/2kqdX6FFi9NjHFkUjw1UngEoiP8).
- I finished reading [Truth of the Divine](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL24198736W/Truth_of_the_Divine) and started on [Apostles of Mercy](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL38083372W/Apostles_of_Mercy), both by Lindsay Ellis.
- We finished watching [White Collar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1358522/). As far as series endings go, I thought it was a pretty good one.
- We watched season 4 of [The Umbrella Academy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1312171/), which was weird. This is a very weird show.
- And we're about halfway through season 9 of [Suits](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701/), which apparently just recently became available on Netflix.
