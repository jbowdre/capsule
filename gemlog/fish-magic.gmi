I've been using (and loving) fish shell for a little while now, and I still frequently discover clever behaviors that make my CLI tasks more enjoyable.

=> https://fishshell.com/ fish shell

Today's discovery: fish will automatically escape single quotes when pasting text into the command line.

=> https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/fish_clipboard_paste.html fish_clipboard_paste - get text from the systemâ€™s clipboard

> If it outputs to the commandline, it will automatically escape the output if the cursor is currently inside single-quotes so it is suitable for single-quotes (meaning it escapes ' and \\).

So if I work up an ugly one-liner for determining the IP address of whatever interface is attached to the default route:

```
ip addr show $(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $5}') | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1
```

And then decide I'd like to make that into a reusable alias, I can copy that line and paste it in after

=> https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/alias.html alias - create a function

```
alias get_ip='
```

and fish will automagically take care of escaping all those troublesome single quotes

```
alias get_ip='ip addr show $(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $5}') | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1'
```

Neat!
