*Here's what I've been up to since the [last weekly status](/this-week-2024-09-22)...*

### Highlights

- This was my second week at the new job and I feel like I'm starting to settle in. During the IT Department's weekly meeting, I was told that I have better hair than most of the women in the office. Just wait until they find out I'm pretty good at computers, too! On that note, I do have a small project to work on, and I've scheduled meetings with some development teams this coming week so I can learn how they build things (and how I can build things to help them build things). I'm excited!
- I do kind of miss the walking route(s) I had at my old job. There don't seem to be any good routes at the new one, but there *are* four flights of stairs between the parking lot and my desk. So I've been trying to walk those more to get some physical activity throughout the day.
- After last weekend's 40(ish)-mile ride, I took a few light rides to recover. And then got back into a threshold training ride on Thursday that *really* kicked my butt. I guess I still had some more recovery to do.
- I skipped Friday and Saturday due to weather, but went out for a relaxing 22-mile ride this morning and felt great. I was chased (briefly) by a dog that appeared out of nowhere to say hi and I saw a person looking *absolutely frickin' ridiculous* on an ellptical bike.

### I learned...

- I figured out how to [trigger a GitHub Actions workflow from another repo](https://notes.runtimeterror.dev/CICD/Trigger-remote-workflow-with-GitHub-Actions).
- It turns out that `{[]}` and `{{}}` don't mean the same thing in SilverBullet configs.

### I tinkered...

- I deployed an Ubuntu 24.04 VM on my homelab to start playing with [podman](https://podman.io/) and specifically [Quadlet](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/quadlet-podman) for managing containers with systemd. It seems pretty neat so far, and I really like the podman approach. I hope to find more time to play with it in the coming weeks.

### I wrote...

- I wrote a detailed post about [Publishing (Selected) SilverBullet Notes with Quartz and GitHub Actions](https://runtimeterror.dev/publish-silverbullet-notes-quartz/).

### I consumed...

- I'm reading [Consider Phlebas](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0c71176b-7de6-4f30-9462-aebeecf944a0) by Iain M. Banks.
- We're binging season 4 of [Only Murders in the Building](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11691774/), and really enjoying it. But we only have a few episodes left before we catch up with the weekly release schedule and that's going to be a rough adjustment.
- We're watching a *lot* of Drag Race as the episodes are released: [Global All Stars](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32919055/), [España](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13606528/) Season 4, and [UK](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9780442/) Season 6. We're also really looking forward to the new season of [Dragula](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6289132/).
- Speaking of delightfully camp and sort of spooky, we also watched [Vamps](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1545106/) and [Lisa Frankenstein](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21188080/).
- I've been listening to [a playlist I put together](https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/d5051feb-43f0-461e-b303-8b990a95fdda) to get ready for a 3-day metal festival next weekend. I just grabbed the top four tracks from each performer, and that added up to over **twenty hours** of music. So I imagine I'll be jamming to that all this week, too. (I just hope this festival goes better than [the last one](https://loudwire.com/blue-ridge-rock-festival-2023-storm-evacuation-camping-parking-problems/) we attended.)

- [NIST published revised password guidelines](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/nist-scraps-passwords-mandatory/): complexity requirements ("x character classes") are out, and minimum lengths are longer. This is great! As [xkcd illustrated](https://xkcd.com/936/), the previous complexity requirements trained use to use "passwords that are hard for humans to remember but easy for computers to guess."
