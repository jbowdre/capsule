I followed [Lou's lead](https://louplummer.lol/taking-a-mental-health-day/) and took a mental health day today. I have some stuff I need to tend to around the house, and I just didn't feel like doing work as well.

I got up at my usual time for a morning ride, but I stayed out later since I didn't have to rush back to shower and head into the office. I covered my typical route and then explored the gravel trail along the river.

It was a nice journey through the shaded woods alongside the river, and the front suspension fork of my [new bicycle](/new-ride/) made for a comfortable ride. Being able to lock the suspension for stability on the road and then unlock it for shock absorption on the trail is *really* nice.

The path also traveled alongside the nearby military installation, so that's something.

All told, I rode just shy of 20 miles in about 1.5 hours, with a few stops for pictures and some deliberately slow sections to lower my heart rate a bit. It was a really nice way to start my rare mental health day!
