*Here's what I've been up to since the last weekly status[1]...*

=> /this-week-2024-09-22 1: last weekly status

### Highlights

- This was my second week at the new job and I feel like I'm starting to settle in. During the IT Department's weekly meeting, I was told that I have better hair than most of the women in the office. Just wait until they find out I'm pretty good at computers, too! On that note, I do have a small project to work on, and I've scheduled meetings with some development teams this coming week so I can learn how they build things (and how I can build things to help them build things). I'm excited!
- I do kind of miss the walking route(s) I had at my old job. There don't seem to be any good routes at the new one, but there *are* four flights of stairs between the parking lot and my desk. So I've been trying to walk those more to get some physical activity throughout the day.

- After last weekend's 40(ish)-mile ride, I took a few light rides to recover. And then got back into a threshold training ride on Thursday that *really* kicked my butt. I guess I still had some more recovery to do.

- I skipped Friday and Saturday due to weather, but went out for a relaxing 22-mile ride this morning and felt great. I was chased (briefly) by a dog that appeared out of nowhere to say hi and I saw a person looking *absolutely frickin' ridiculous* on an ellptical bike.

### I learned...

- I figured out how to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow from another repo[1].

- It turns out that `{[]}` and `{{}}` don't mean the same thing in SilverBullet configs.

### I tinkered...

- I deployed an Ubuntu 24.04 VM on my homelab to start playing with podman[1] and specifically Quadlet[2] for managing containers with systemd. It seems pretty neat so far, and I really like the podman approach. I hope to find more time to play with it in the coming weeks.

### I wrote...

- I wrote a detailed post about Publishing (Selected) SilverBullet Notes with Quartz and GitHub Actions[1].

### I consumed...

- I'm reading Consider Phlebas[1] by Iain M. Banks.

- We're binging season 4 of Only Murders in the Building[1], and really enjoying it. But we only have a few episodes left before we catch up with the weekly release schedule and that's going to be a rough adjustment.
- We're watching a *lot* of Drag Race as the episodes are released: Global All Stars[2], España[3] Season 4, and UK[4] Season 6. We're also really looking forward to the new season of Dragula[5].

- Speaking of delightfully camp and sort of spooky, we also watched Vamps[1] and Lisa Frankenstein[2].

- I've been listening to a playlist I put together[1] to get ready for a 3-day metal festival next weekend. I just grabbed the top four tracks from each performer, and that added up to over **twenty hours** of music. So I imagine I'll be jamming to that all this week, too. (I just hope this festival goes better than the last one[2] we attended.)
