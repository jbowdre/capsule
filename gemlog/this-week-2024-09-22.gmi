### Highlights

- **First week at my new job**, and I kind of love it. I'm hugely impressed with what I've seen (so far) of the company, the people, and the way they're doing IT. They already have very good collaboration and integration between the application, development, operations, and security teams, and it seems like a perfect time for a new Platform Architect (ğŸ‘‹) to come in and build cool solutions to help further streamline things.

Oh, and I [had to create a slide](https://social.lol/@jbowdre/113110835044998834) to introduce myself to the management team. I think I nailed it: ![A collage showing various aspects of John Bowdreâ€™s life. Text reads "John Bowdre, Corporate, Platform Architect, 'The Cloud.'" Top left: a stage with flames and "LOUD NOISES" caption. Top right: Star Trek's Enterprise labeled "sci-fi fan." Center: disassembled robot connected to a laptop labeled "mad scientist." Middle right: bike in front of "Gate Closed" sign labeled "recreational cyclist." Bottom center: two dogs named "Pippin" and "Merry" with label "married with two children." Bottom left: hand holding a LEGO spaceship labeled "LEGO + space." Bottom right: a racing car labeled "professional driver on a closed course." Text also notes "raised in BHM, in HSV since 2008."](https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/jbowdre/intro_slide.png)

- I got in a few rides with my new power-sensing pedals and am pretty pleased with the results. In addition to just consuming that "raw" power data, it's also used for various computed metrics to provide a better picture of exertion. It will likely take another week or so for that data to really get factored into my training recommendations but I'm digging it so far. Yay data!
- I celebrated 4 years of Duolingo! I started learning German after binging Dark[1] 4 years ago, and I've kept at it (almost) every day since then. (And I also started learning Esperanto earlier this year. Learning is fun!)
- I wrapped up the week with a long bike ride[2] on Saturday. A friend and I did the 40(ish) mile loop of the 40th Annual SCCC All-You-Can-Eat Century[3] event, which took us from northern Huntsville to the Tennessee state line and back - and then let us celebrate with all the barbecue we could eat. I'm hoping to do the 64-mile ("metric century") course next year.

This was my first time actually using the [SeaSucker Talon bike rack](https://www.seasucker.com/collections/bike/products/talon) that I picked up [back in July](/this-week-2024-07-13/), and I was really happy with how it performed. My bike stayed secure even across some very rough sections of pavement.

### I tinkered...

- I finished migrating all of my Docker containers to be managed by Portainer which has dramatically simplified how I monitor the containers and keep the images up to date.
- I switched all my use of Cloudflare Tunnels to a more vendor-agnostic approach using Caddy and Tailscale.

### I wrote...

- ... and I wrote some notes on how I did that[1].
