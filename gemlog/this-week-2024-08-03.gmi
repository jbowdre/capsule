### New Posts!

- I saw A Day To Remember in Nashville, and it was a show to remember[1].
=> /a-concert-to-remember/ 1: a show to remember

- I played a bit with Tailscale's new(ish) Taildrive feature[1].
- And I purchased yet another new domain[2] - surprise, you're looking at it! 🎉

### runtimeterror Tweaks

- I found some code from Luke Harris[1] (and an accompanying blog post[2] to configure Hugo to dynamically build a `robots.txt` file from the Dark Visitors[3] API. I really liked that idea since I honestly can't keep up with all the sketchy scrapers and will forget to update the file on my own. So I replaced my previous setup[4] with Luke's dynamic approach.

- I also swapped out the recentfm widget[1] in the sidebar for some cobbled-together JavaScript[2] to pull the latest "pinned" track from my Now Playing Musicthread[3]. I like the idea of sharing a track that's stuck with me rather than just whatever happened to be played last.
- And I tinkered a bit with the Typo[4] implementation which "types" (with randomized jitter, typos, and self-corrections) the randomly-selected taglines/errors at the top of the sidebar. I had noticed that sometimes mistakes made near the end of the phrase didn't get corrected; I altered it[5] so that it wouldn't insert typos in the last 3 characters.

### In Other News...

- I updated my /uses page[1] to swap the Garmin fenix 7 in for the Pixel Watch 2 I was using previously, and to switch to ControlD from NextDNS now that it's officially supported[2] by Tailscale.

- We went to see Deadpool &amp; Wolverine last night, and it was such a fun film. I was cackling basically the whole time - much to my wife's annoyance.
- I'm back on my Golang learning, currently working through a deep dive on functions and such.
