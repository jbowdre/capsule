*Boarding the Bear blog bandwagon!*

I have seen a number of omglolers ( *ohm-guh-loll-ers* ) switching to [Bearblog](https://bearblog.dev) lately so I thought I'd check it out... and yeah, my little weblog thingy has a new home. I love the lightweight, simple-but-configurable approach, and I'm impressed by the developer's [philosophy on building software](https://herman.bearblog.dev/building-software-to-last-forever/) and [clever solutions to technical challenges](https://herman.bearblog.dev/how-bear-does-analytics-with-css/). And I'm happy to be able to write/format posts with HTML and/or Markdown rather than a WYSIWYG editor.

By this point I have migrated all of my posts from Scribbles, and I employed a combination of post aliases and a Bunny edge rule to redirect existing links to the new locations (hopefully I didn't miss anything important). I'll be tinkering with the look and feel of this place for a few days (at least) but I wanted to go ahead and say "Hi, I'm here!".
