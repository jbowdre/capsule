*Here's what I've been up to since the [last weekly status](/this-week-2024-07-27/)...*

### New Posts!

- I saw A Day To Remember in Nashville, and it was [a show to remember](/a-concert-to-remember/).
- I played a bit with [Tailscale's new(ish) Taildrive feature](https://runtimeterror.dev/taking-taildrive-testdrive/).
- And I purchased [yet another new domain](/new-domain/) - surprise, you're looking at it! 🎉

### runtimeterror Tweaks

- I found [some code from Luke Harris](https://github.com/lkhrs/hugo-dark-visitors) (and an accompanying [blog post](https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2024/darkvisitors-hugo/) to configure Hugo to dynamically build a `robots.txt` file from the [Dark Visitors](https://darkvisitors.com/) API. I really liked that idea since I honestly can't keep up with all the sketchy scrapers and will forget to update the file on my own. So I replaced my [previous setup](https://runtimeterror.dev/blocking-ai-crawlers/) with Luke's dynamic approach.
- I also swapped out the [recentfm widget](https://recentfm.rknight.me/) in the sidebar for some [cobbled-together JavaScript](https://github.com/jbowdre/runtimeterror/blob/main/assets/js/theme-song.js) to pull the latest "pinned" track from my [Now Playing Musicthread](https://musicthread.app/thread/2aVjZUocjk96LELFbV5JvJjm14v). I like the idea of sharing a track that's stuck with me rather than just whatever happened to be played last.
- And I tinkered a bit with the [Typo](https://neatnik.net/typo/) implementation which "types" (with randomized jitter, typos, and self-corrections) the randomly-selected taglines/errors at the top of the sidebar. I had noticed that sometimes mistakes made near the end of the phrase didn't get corrected; I [altered it](https://github.com/jbowdre/runtimeterror/blob/main/assets/js/typo.js) so that it wouldn't insert typos in the last 3 characters.

### In Other News...

- I updated my [/uses page](/uses/) to swap the Garmin fenix 7 in for the Pixel Watch 2 I was using previously, and to switch to ControlD from NextDNS now that it's [officially supported](https://tailscale.com/blog/controld) by Tailscale.
- We went to see Deadpool &amp; Wolverine last night, and it was such a fun film. I was cackling basically the whole time - much to my wife's annoyance.
- I'm back on my Golang learning, currently working through a deep dive on functions and such.
