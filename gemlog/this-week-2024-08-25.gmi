Here's what I've been up to since the last weekly status[1]...\*

=> /this-week-2024-08-18 1: last weekly status

### Highlights

- After last week's post, I did receive the special socket I needed to tighten the retaining cups on my bike's bottom bracket and (even better) adjusting those cups did completely resolve the pedaling issue I'd been experiencing. The bike feels great again!
- Though I did somehow manage to break my phone mount. I've ordered a different one[1] that should (hopefully) hold up a bit better.

- For the first time since childhood, I rode my bike every day this past week - and racked up **111 miles** in the process. I'm following a training plan created by the Garmin Coach feature on my Fenix 7 watch to get ready for a 40-mile group ride next month. I'm feeling pretty good! - And I spent this afternoon doing *more* bike maintenance, namely adjusting the front and rear derailleurs on both of my bike's and my wife's. Mechanical work is always so satisfying (one you get past it being immensely frustrating, of course).

- In non-cycling news, we drove to Montgomery (and back) yesterday to celebrate my nibling's first birthday. My wife and I aren't really into children, but I've got to admit that watching Nib turn a cake into a giant mess that we weren't responsible for in any way was pretty fun. Plus it's always nice to see my brother and my parents.
- Oh, and **I got a new job![1]** 🎉 I can't wait to start it in a few weeks.

### I learned...

- That Windows has a built-in `tar` command (now? not sure when that showed up). Being able to work with "foreign" archive formats without having to install any third-party utilities is very handy.
- I also learned about the 8 versions of UUID and when to use them[1].

### I tinkered...

- I added anchor links to section headers on my other blog[1]. *I should figure out how to do that here on Bear too...* - I'm just getting started with using Portainer[2] to manage my Docker workloads. I don't know why I put this off for so long, it's actually *really* slick. Especially when I've got dozens of container stacks running on a few different hosts. It's not quite container orchestration, but seriously improves the manageability of my sprawling containers.

- We finished season 9 of Suits[1] which was... fine. I don't think the ending (or the final season) was very strong.
- We watched The Decameron[2] which was dumb and entertaining, exactly our cup of tea.
- And we've started watching Mayfair Witches[3] which is enjoyable so far.
- I'm still working my way through Apostles of Mercy by Lindsay Ellis[4].
