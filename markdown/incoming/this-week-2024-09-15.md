*Here's what I've been up to since the [last weekly status](/this-week-2024-09-08)...*

### Highlights

- This week was kind of a blur as a I scrambled to tie up remaining loose ends leading up to my last day at work. It took a lot of doing but I'm pleased with how I left things; hopefully all the stuff I built won't fall apart *too* quickly without me.
- My (now former) boss surprised me with a letter of recommendation that says some really nice things about me. That feels pretty good.
- I'm expecting a sizeable payout for my (extensive) unused vacation time so I splurged on some bike gear: a pair of [Garmin Rally XC200](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/658594/pn/010-02388-04) power-sensing pedals. We got some weather toward the end of the week so I haven't had a chance to ride with them yet, but I'm really looking forward to tracking my power data starting tomorrow.
- I ended the week with a much-needed [autocross race](/autocross-2024-09-15/). (I always get a bit twitchy when it's been too long between events.)

### I wrote...

- I [reflected a bit](/the-end-of-something-and-the-start-of-something-else/) on the things I accomplished in my last job as I get ready to start a new one. It was pretty satisfying to look back at the impact I had there.

### I consumed...

- We watched the final installment of [The Grand Tour](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5712554/): *One for the Road*. I've been following the vehicular adventures of Clarkson, Hammond, and May for twenty years, and this last hurrah was a good one to end on. But man, I'm going to miss watching those guys. (Also, Zimbabwe is stunning!)
- We started [Only Murders in the Building](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11691774/) and I'm enjoying it quite a lot. Steve Martin and Martin Short are such a delight together.
- My wife and I continued our little [Alien marathon](https://social.lol/@jbowdre/113063508949466862) with [Alien: Covenant](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2316204). I guess now we'll have to go see [Alien: Romulus](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18412256/) soon.
- We also watched [Elvira: Mistress of the Dark](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095088/). What a treat!
- I finished reading Jason Pargin's [If This Book Exists, You're in the Wrong Universe](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ebe5fe68-4aad-4dd7-9df0-30b00405f6af), and started reading [Consider Phlebas](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0c71176b-7de6-4f30-9462-aebeecf944a0) by Iain M. Banks.
