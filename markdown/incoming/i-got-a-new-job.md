After applying to 200+ positions over the past four months (and getting interviewed for just *two* of them - it's rough out there!), I'm **super** excited to have accepted an offer for a position that's basically tailor-made for my skills and aspirations. I'm looking forward to being able to focus on the sort of platform-y work that I want to do. It's going to be so much fun!

Of course, before I can get to the new gig I'll spend the next three weeks wrapping up and/or handing off everything that I'd been working on for my current employer. It's a good thing that past-John typically did a good job of documenting things as he went. Still, it's going to be a busy few weeks!

Oh, and that *other* position that I interviewed for? I got rejected, and the company went on to [break the entire world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident) the following week. So I guess that one actually worked out pretty well for me, too.
