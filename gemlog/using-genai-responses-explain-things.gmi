Nobody gains anything from copy-and-pasting an AI-generated explanation of `$topic` into a chat, email, discussion forum, blog post, or other communication. Such explanations are often incomplete or inaccurate, and sharing them in that way comes across as a low-effort attempt to show everyone how smart you are(n't). It doesn't help anyone.

If you want to explain something to someone, do it in your own words! Not only does that allow you to tailor the explanation to the audience and context, but it will usually help you develop a better understanding of the topic as well.

Your audience will learn something, and you probably will too - everybody wins!
