About two weeks ago, I [suddenly developed a fever](https://social.lol/@jbowdre/112406020756949481) that knocked me out for a solid 24 hours before going away. I felt better the next day, and then worse the one after that, so I went to a clinic. I tested negative for all the cool trendy stuff, and was prescribed steroids and antibiotics to help me get over my off-brand upper respiratory infection.

I started to feel better pretty quickly, but even as my other symptoms improved my brain felt like it was stuck in a fog. I struggled to focus, had trouble following complex thoughts, and just couldn't get it to engage on any meaningful tasks. It was awful. I had all these things I wanted and needed to be working on, but my head refused to get in gear.

That fog finally started to lift over this weekend, and I feel almost back to normal this morning. I can think again! Now I just need to figure out where I left off on those various projects so I can get back to work.
