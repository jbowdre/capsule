I tend to drop a lot of links in my posts. Some point to other posts/pages within the same site, but many point to external sites. As a *reader*, I like to know where a link is going to take me, but as a *writer*, I'm not always great about indicating that context within the text.

I mentioned in my inaugural "This Week" post[1] that I recently discovered how to use Hugo's link render-hook templates[2] to automatically apply a little `â†—` marker to external links posted on runtimeterror[3]. All that took was creating `layouts/_default/_markup/render-link.html` with the following content to overwrite the default rendering:

=> https://gohugo.io/render-hooks/links/ 2: Hugo's link render-hook templates
=> https://runtimeterror.dev 3: runtimeterror

```
{{- $u := urls.Parse .Destination -}}

  {{- with .Text | safeHTML }}{{ . }}{{ end -}}
  {{- if $u.IsAbs }}â†—{{ end -}}

{{- /* chomp trailing newline */ -}}
```

That works well with Hugo since the marker gets inserted into the HTML source code at build time. But what about here on Bear?

So I went looking for a CSS-based solution that would work here. It only took about 30 seconds of searching to find a post from Jake Bauer[1] with the relevant CSS bits.

All I needed was to add this block to my Bear theme CSS:

```
a[href^="http"]:where(:not([href*="srsbsns.lol/"]))::after {
    content: "â†—"
}
```

That was surprisingly easy, and today I learned you can use complex/compound selectors to perform pattern matching with CSS. Neat!
