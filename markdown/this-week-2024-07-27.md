*Here's what I've been up to since the [last weekly status](/this-week-2024-07-19/)...*

### (Another) New Blog Post

As promised last week, I followed up [a lengthy post on how to use Packer to build VM templates on Promox](https://runtimeterror.dev/building-proxmox-templates-packer/) with another deep-dive on [automating the template builds with GitHub Actions](https://runtimeterror.dev/automate-packer-builds-github-actions/). That second post went a lot more quickly than the first, which was a relief - I wasn't really prepared to sit on it for another ~6 weeks.

I've been using that GitHub Actions setup to build fresh templates in my homelab every week, and it feels great to finally have the whole setup documented.

### 0.001 Seconds

Today was our club's seventh autocross event of the year. Those races are always a highlight of my month, but the competition today was particularly satisfying. After some intense back-and-forth action, I was pretty pleased with this 51.779-second run which put me comfortably in second place:

... until a competitor finished with a *51.778*, knocking me ever-so-slightly back into third.

0.001 seconds isn't very long, but makes for some really exciting racing!

### In Other News...

- I'm still surviving the Great CrowdStrike Outage of 2024. I haven't been directly impacted but I have been following the developments pretty closely. Large-scale failures are kind of fascinating and offer a lot of opportunities for learning how to do better. I just hope CrowdStrike is learning a *lot* from this.
- I'm reading [Truth of the Divine](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL24198736W/Truth_of_the_Divine?edition=ia%3Atruthofdivineboo0000lind) by Lindsay Ellis. It has been a few years since I read [Axiom's End](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20914838W/Axiom%27s_End?edition=ia%3Aaxiomsendnovel0000elli), the first in the series, and I'm kind of wishing I had re-read it before starting the sequel. I really suck at remembering what happened from one book to the next.
- I had put the Golong learning on pause while I focused on getting those Packer-related blog posts published. I'm looking forward to picking that back up!
