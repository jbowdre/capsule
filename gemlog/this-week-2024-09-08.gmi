*Here's what I've been up to since the last weekly status[1]...*

=> /this-week-2024-09-01 1: last weekly status

### Highlights

- Most of this work week was spent getting one of my major projects wrapped up, documented, and handed off to the team that will be responsible for it once I leave. It includes probably the largest program I've ever written and I'm really proud of the state in which I'm leaving it. It's so much better than it was when I inherited the project last year.
- Speaking of which, I'm down to five more working days in my current position before I start the new job next week. I still have a few smaller projects to transfer to someone else but I'm hoping it will be a fairly relaxing week as I wind things down. We'll see.
- I rode 29 miles on Saturday, by far my longest ride in the past year. This should be my last week of ramp-up training, and then I'll taper off a bit to be ready for the ~40 mile group ride on the 21st. I'm really looking forward to that one.
- I stumbled upon The StoryGraph[1] and have started using that to keep track of my reading[2]. It's much prettier and easier to use than Open Library[3] that I had previously been using for that purpose.

### I learned...

- Some networks like to block outbound SSH traffic, which can make interacting with GitHub repos a little tricky. But this week I learned that GitHub also offers [SSH over the HTTPS port](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/using-ssh-over-the-https-port) which can help to get around such silly limitations.```
```
# test to see if it actually works
ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
# if so, clone away
git clone ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/USERNAME/REPO.git
```
```

### I wrote...

- I've been working on a detailed post about my recent robot-hacking adventures[1], trying to capture *every* step in one place. I even re-disassembled the robot this afternoon so I could accurately report which screws needed to be removed (just 40 of them) *and* document the process with photos. That Markdown file is about 400 lines now, and I've still yet to cover the process of integrating the newly-hacked robot with Home Assistant. I'm not sure when I'll finally wrap up that post but I hope it will be later this week.

### I consumed...

- We continued the Alien marathon that we started the previous week. This week included AlienÂ³[1], Alien Resurrection[2], and Prometheus[3] (the one film in the franchise that I had seen before).

- We also watched Season 1 of Kaos[1], a modern day retelling of Greek mythology. This was a really fun watch. And Jeff Goldblum as Zeus was an absolute treat, and the soundtrack was quite solid. I'd love to see more of this.
- I started reading If This Book Exists, You're in the Wrong Universe[2] by Jason Pargin.
- Watching Season 2 of House of the Dragon[3]; I'm not ashamed to admit that I don't actually have any idea what's going on but my wife seems to be enjoying it.
- I can't get enough of the new Linkin Park track[4]. I'm so excited for the band to return, and I think Emily Armstrong's unique vocal style is a great addition.

- Paul Otto experimented with using Matter to control a light with a Raspberry Pi[2], and provided a lot of great background information about how Matter works.
- Mathew Duggan told us Why Login Security Sucks[3], and why it's such a challenging problem to solve elegantly.
