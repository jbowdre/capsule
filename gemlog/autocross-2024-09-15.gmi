The Twickenham Auto Club[1] hosted its eigth autocross event of the season today. I had been a bit afraid about the weather given the forecast toward the end of the week, but the conditions turned out to be pretty great.

The course was challenging but flowed well, and I really enjoyed my time on course. Still, this wasn't my best bit of racing; I finished in fourth out of four.

I got to ride with each of my competitors and learned that they were *just driving faster* throughout the whole course. I'm not sure why I'd never thought to try that before, but I'll have to remember it for next time.
